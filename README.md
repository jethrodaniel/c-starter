# c-starter

This a basic starter template for c code.

## Installation

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jethrodaniel/c-starter.git your-project-name

cd your-project-name

./setup.sh
```

It's that easy.

## Tests

Two kinds of tests are used:
  - Unit tests (in C) with [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity)
  - CLI tests (in Gherkin) with [Aruba/Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba)
    - Requires [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
    - Aruba [documentation](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/aruba/documents/branch/master/)

## TODO

- [ ] Add more example tests
- [ ] Actually add the `Rakefile`
- [ ] Use git username for `LICENSE`
